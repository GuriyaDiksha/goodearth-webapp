          "Why choose the Good Earth for Asian Paints Nilaya wallcoverings collection?",
        answer: (
          <>
            1. The Silk Route collection of bespoke wallcoverings has been
            designed by Good Earth, exclusively for Asian Paints Nilaya, in our
            signature style. Asian Paints Nilaya is the finest wallcoverings
            brand in the country, and they have ensured that every element of
            design – from the lines of detail to the colour and tone – is
            faithfully expressed.
            <br />
            <br />
            The range has been manufactured at one of the best wallcovering
            factories in the world. Based in Lancashire, the factory uses only
            water-based colours to create the wallcoverings, a process that
            resonates with Good Earth’s philosophy of sustainability. Some of
            the key designs of the collection have been printed using
            traditional techniques with engraved rollers to transpose patterns
            onto a textured non-woven substrate.

            The wallcoverings retail in standard sized rolls. Each roll can
            cover an approximate area of 50 sq feet. Actual coverage depends on
            a range of factors – pattern repeat, condition of the walls,
            presence of niches/pillars etc.

            We can help you calculate the number of rolls for your requirements.
            Measure in ft the height and width of the wall you wish to decorate,
            making sure that you subtract the measurements of the windows, doors
            and other functional areas. Use our calculator tool by keying in the
            final measurements, and we’ll recommend the number of rolls to
            purchase based on this. Our rolls measure 50 sq ft each.

            Asian Paints Ezycolour Home Solutions charges Rs. 1500 per roll for
            application, and this price includes sealer, adhesive and labour

      {
        ques: "How long will the installation process take?",
        answer: (
          <>
            The installation process generally takes one day for a wall that
            measures 150 sq ft. However, installation time will depend on the
            area to be covered. After installation, the wallcoverings generally
            take 24-48 hours to dry completely.

        ques: "How do I maintain the wallcovering?",
        answer: (
          <>
            Relatively easy to maintain, non-washable wallcoverings can be
            cleaned using dry methods such as vacuuming the wallcovering or
            dusting with a sponge/soft cloth. When vacuuming, use a soft brush
            attachment to avoid damaging the texture. Some of the wallcoverings
            can be cleaned gently using a wet sponge. Please refer to the
            leaflet in the roll for exact details on maintenance.

      {
        ques: "How do I treat cuts and peeling?",
        answer: (
          <>
            In case of wallcovering damage, the affected area can be replaced
            with the same pattern. This requires a bit of care (to avoid ruining
            the surrounding area). It might be best to contact the Asian Paints
            Nilaya helpline or your retailer. In the rare scenario of the
            wallcovering peeling, it can be set right with a suitable adhesive
            like Nilaya Premium Wall Covering Adhesive. However, if the peeling
            has been caused by wall damage, like a leakage or moisture problem,
            the wallcoverings can only be re-fixed once the core issue has been
            resolved.
